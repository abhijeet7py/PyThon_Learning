# âœ… Grade Calculator:
# Write a program that calculates and displays the letter grade
# for a given numerical score (e.g., A, B, C, D, or F)
# based on the following grading scale:
#
# A: 90-100
# B: 80-89
# C: 70-79
# D: 60-69
# F: 0-59

score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if 90 <= score <= 100:
    grade = "A"
elif 80 <= score < 90:
    grade = "B"
elif 70 <= score < 80:
    grade = "C"
elif 60 <= score < 70:
    grade = "D"
elif 0 <= score < 60:
    grade = "F"
else:
    grade = "Invalid score"

print(f"Your grade is {grade}.")
