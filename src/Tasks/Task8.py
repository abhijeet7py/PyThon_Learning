# âœ… Triangle Classifier:
# Write a program that classifies a triangle based on its side lengths.
# Given three input values representing the lengths of the sides,
# determine if the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal),
# isosceles (exactly two sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal).
# Use an if-else statement to classify the triangle.

#Triangle Classifier:

length1 = int(input("Enter the length of side 1 of triangle : \n"))
length2 = int(input("Enter the length of side 2 of triangle : \n"))
length3 = int(input("Enter the length of side 3 of triangle : \n"))


if length1 ==length2 == length3:
    print(f"From {length1} ,{length2},{length3}, All sides are  equal, Hence the triangle is Equilateral  ")
elif length1 == length2!=length3 or length1 == length3!=length2 or length2 == length3!=length1:
    print(f"From {length1} ,{length2},{length3}, two sides are equal, Hence the triangle is Isosceles ")
else:
    print(f"From {length1} ,{length2},{length3}, no sides are equal, Hence the triangle is scalene")
